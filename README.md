# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C

## Description

This repository contains the source code for a Tic Tac Toe game developed in C. This game offers two modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Computer. In the Player vs Player mode, two players can compete against each other. In the Player vs Computer mode, a player can compete against the computer, which uses an algorithm to make its moves.

### How to Play
### The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, and each cell in the grid is numbered from 1 to 9, like this:
## 
## 1 | 2 | 3
## 4 | 5 | 6
## 7 | 8 | 9
Players take turns to put their mark (X or O) in the cell they choose. The first player uses X as their mark, and the second player (or the computer) uses O.
The aim is to get three of their own marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The player who first gets 3 of their marks in a row wins the game.
If all the cells are marked and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.

# How to Run

You can compile and run the tic-tac-toe.c file using a C compiler. For example, if you are using the GCC compiler, you can use the following commands:

gcc tic-tac-toe.c -o tic-tac-toe

./tic-tac-toe

### Note: 
In the Player vs Computer mode, the computer uses a certain algorithm to decide its move. This makes the game challenging and fun.

Have fun playing the game!
